            Communications happen in a variety of forms for all of us across a typical day and in almost every form of
            communication you can think of – speaking and listening, reading and writing, presenting, signing and
            signalling – and your abilities in these areas can have a significant bearing on success in event
            management.

            “It’s essential to be a phenomenal communicator both written and oral” comments Martin Turner, Senior
            Lecturer at Event Academy. Whilst that’s good news for those individuals who are natural communicators, who
            can get their point across succinctly and understand what it means to be clear, concise and effective when
            it comes to communicating what they want, the demand doesn’t end there! In events, it’s not just about
            communicating information from person to person – it’s also the ability to present and communicate ideas.
            Running naturally alongside communication is the ability to engage with others effectively, which includes
            being approachable and able to work productively in teams. “Such people skills are recognized as being
            important at any level of expertise or position in the pack,” points out Justine Kane, Course Director at
            Event Academy. “Event managers need to be a leaders and team players.”

            All the experts agree that having the ability to handle budgets is key to success. Whilst a natural aptitude
            for numbers can certainly support this, the ability to manage budgets, plus skills in negotiating as part of
            effective money management, are certainly professional skills which may also be learned.
